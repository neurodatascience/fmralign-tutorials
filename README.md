A collection of tutorials for functional alignment methods in fMRI data.
This repository does not include implementations of these methods; for this,
we recommend [BrainIAK](http://brainiak.org/),
[fmralign](https://github.com/Parietal-INRIA/fmralign), or
[pyMVPA](http://www.pymvpa.org/).

Here, we demonstrate functional alignment methods using the publicly accessible [Pixar dataset](https://osf.io/5hju4/), generously shared by the Saxe group.
For more information on the acquisition of this data set, please see their paper:

Data were pre-processed using [fMRIPrep](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io) version 1.3.0.post2.
For the exact processing pipeline, please see the fMRIPrep-generated methods section,
available [here](https://osf.io/wjtyq/).
