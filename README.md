[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neurodatascience/fmralign-tutorials/master)

A collection of tutorials for functional alignment methods in fMRI data.
This repository does not include implementations of these methods; for this,
we recommend [BrainIAK](http://brainiak.org/),
[fmralign](https://github.com/Parietal-INRIA/fmralign), or
[pyMVPA](http://www.pymvpa.org/).

Here, we demonstrate functional alignment methods using the publicly accessible [MTL dataset](https://osf.io/vgj7w/), generously shared by Aly and colleagues.
For more information on the acquisition of this data set, please see their paper:

  _Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience_, 30(9): 1345-1365.

Data were pre-processed using [fMRIPrep](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io) version 1.5.0rc1.
For a full description of the pipeline, please see the Open Science Framework [README](https://osf.io/479pt/).
