    "Functional alignment methods have applications across a broad variety of domains.\n",
    "Three of particular relevance here are cognitive neuroscience, systems neuroscience and artificial intelligence.\n",
    "We briefly overview each in turn to highlight unique considerations relevant to each field.\n",

    "\n",
    "In cognitive neuroscience, functional alignment methods have been developed and applied for both fMRI as well as M/EEG data.\n",
