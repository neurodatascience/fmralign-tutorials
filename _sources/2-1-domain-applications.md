# Domain applications

Functional alignment methods have applications across a broad variety of domains.
Three of particular relevance here are cognitive neuroscience, systems neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

In cognitive neuroscience, functional alignment methods have been developed and applied for both fMRI as well as M/EEG data.

In systems neuroscience, latent variable functional alignment methods are widely used to make comparisons across animals or experimental conditions with electrophysiological data.

In artificial intelligence, functional alignment methods can be used to compare networks with different initializations or at different stages in training.
