    "# Regularized Canonical Correlation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a form of multi-view learning\n",
    "where we have paired observations or \"views\" that contain complementary information on an underlying (or \"latent\") process.\n",
    "CCA learns two linear projections ---one for each view---\n",
    "such that the projected data points are maximally correlated.\n",
    "That is, the paired data points are projected into a shared space such that they lie as close as possible to one another.\n",
    "These linear projections can be considered to reflect features of the structure of the data\n",
    "and may thus be useful for downstream prediction tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another perspective on CCA comes from considering it as a prediction task itself.\n",
    "Specifically, because CCA assumes that each set of observations is dependent on\n",
    "one or more shared latent variables,\n",
    "we could learn the relevant linear projections on a subset of the data and apply them on a held-out portion of the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we'll consider the mathematics of CCA to guide our intuitions about the method.\n",
    "Departing somewhat from classical CCA walk-throughs,\n",
    "we'll focus on regularized CCA and its usage in predictive contexts.\n",
    "This focus will allow us to consider applications of regularized CCA as a functional alignment method in both the neuroscience and artificial intelligence literatures.\n",

    "## Formalizing the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have two mean-centered data matrices\n",
    "$X_a \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p_1}$ and\n",
    "$X_b \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p_2}$,\n",
    "where $n$ is the number of samples, and $p_1, p_2$ are the number of units for each network.\n",
    "We can say without loss of generality that $p_1 \\leq p_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we consider these two sets of activation patterns to be paired,\n",
    "we can note the $i$-th sample as two row vectors,\n",
    "$(\\mathbf{x}_a^i, \\mathbf{x}_b^i)$ with dimensionality $p_1$ and $p_2$, respectively.\n",
    "We thus have $n$ paired observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying linear projections to our original $X_a$ and $X_b$ matrices,\n",
    "we can then generate a pair of _canonical components_ or _canonical variables_.\n",
    "We denote these as $\\mathbf{z}_a \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$\n",
    "and $\\mathbf{z}_b \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that:\n",
